1. Do not support anonymous class at the moment. 
2. [SOLVED]Class needs to be compiled by a top-down order in type hierarchy
3. Not sure if interface can have subinterface (currently I don't maintain typehierarchy for interfaces)
4. Current implementation is very x86\mac os\gcc specific
   4.1 gcc: buildin_prefetch in magic types
   4.2 mac os: prebuilt boehm_gc.a
   4.3 x86: magic type width
