1. [SOLVED]Do not support anonymous(nested) class at the moment. 
2. [SOLVED]Class needs to be compiled by a top-down order in type hierarchy
3. An interface cannot have subinterface - this is for implementation ease at the moment. 
   If we want subinterface, we need to class_init interfaces, and maintain its hierarchy
4. Current implementation is very x86\mac os\gcc specific
   4.1 gcc: buildin_prefetch/CAS in magic types
   4.2 mac os: prebuilt boehm_gc.a, RawMemory, wait() (use mach time)
5. Magic Type Generator is broken (dont know since when)
6. Not supporting Thread.interrupt() and InterruptedException
